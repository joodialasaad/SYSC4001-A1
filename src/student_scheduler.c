 * This is the source file you must complete.

 * You are responsible for implementing the simulated operating-system

 *   - PCBs and process states;
 *   - the ready queue and waiting processes;
 *   - CPU and I/O burst accounting;
 *   - FCFS, Round Robin, and preemptive SRTF;
 *   - dispatch/context-switch overhead; and
 *   - calls to the supplied metrics and CSV logging functions.
 *
 * You may replace this file completely and add any .c/.h files you need.
 * The types and helper functions below are only a suggested decomposition.
 * You may rename, replace, combine, or remove them.
 */

 * Suggested PCB starting point. Add the fields required by the handout, such
 * as remaining CPU time, completed bursts, I/O completion time, Ready-entry
 * order, and RR quantum usage.

/*
 * Supplied output API examples
 * ----------------------------
 * These functions are declared in scheduler.h and implemented in io.c. They
 * format the CSV rows for you and calculate the metrics. You must use them
 * to ensure your output can be correctly processed by the test harness.
 *
 * State transition:
 *
 *   log_transition(output, time, pid,
 *                  STATE_NEW, STATE_READY, REASON_ARRIVAL);
 *
 * One timeline interval [time, time + 1):
 *
 *  If the CPU is running a process:
 *      record_timeline_tick(output, time, ACTIVITY_CPU, running_pid);
 *
 *  If the CPU is performing a context switch:
 *      record_timeline_tick(output, time, ACTIVITY_CONTEXT_SWITCH, 0);
 *
 *  If the CPU is idle:
 *      record_timeline_tick(output, time, ACTIVITY_IDLE, 0);
 *
 * Final metrics (one call after every process terminates):
 *
 *   if (!write_metrics(output, specs, count)) {
 *       return false;
 *   }
 *

/*
 * Suggested helper decomposition (optional)
 * -----------------------------------------
 * You may find helpers with responsibilities like these useful:
 *
 *   initialize_pcbs(...)
 *   ready_enqueue(...)
 *   choose_next_process(...)
 *   admit_arrivals(...)
 *   complete_io(...)
 *   maybe_preempt_srtf(...)
 *   update_dispatch(...)
 *   advance_one_interval(...)
 *
 * Required event-loop order
 * -------------------------
 *
 *   while not all processes are terminated:
 *       resolve the CPU interval that ended at the current time
 *       admit arrivals in ascending PID order
 *       complete I/O in ascending PID order
 *       apply the SRTF preemption rule, if applicable
 *       complete or begin dispatch/context-switch activity
 *       record exactly one CPU, context-switch, or idle timeline tick
 *       advance time by one
 *
 * You must design and implement the loop yourself. The reference outputs care
 * about observable timing and ordering, not the names of your private helpers.
 */

/*
 * Run one complete scheduling simulation.
 *
 * Parameters
 * ----------
 * specs:
 *     A read-only array of validated process descriptions, sorted by ascending
 *     PID. Each entry supplies the arrival time, CPU- and I/O-burst lengths,
 *     and number of CPU bursts for one process. Copy entries into your PCBs if
 *     you need mutable per-process state. Do not modify or free this array.
 *
 * count:
 *     The number of ProcessSpec entries in specs.
 *
 * config:
 *     A read-only SimulationConfig containing the selected algorithm, the RR
 *     quantum, and the context-switch duration. The quantum affects scheduling
 *     only when config->algorithm is ALG_RR. Do not modify or free config.
 *
 * output:
 *     An already-open output context. Pass it to log_transition(),
 *     record_timeline_tick(), and write_metrics() as described above. main.c
 *     owns this context and will close it; do not close or free it here.
 *
 * Return true after the simulation and final metrics are written successfully.
 * Return false if initialization, simulation, or output generation fails.
 * main.c retains ownership of specs, config, and output in either case.
